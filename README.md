## Object Detection

[Simple Object Tracking with OpenCV]()

Perform simple object tracking with OpenCV using an algorithm called centroid tracking.

[YOLO Object Detection](https://github.com/shejz/Object-Detection/tree/main/YOLO%20Object%20Detection)

I’ll be using YOLOv3 in this project, in particular, pre-trained (on the COCO dataset) model files.

[People Counter](https://github.com/shejz/Object-Detection/tree/main/People%20Counter)

I’ll count the number of people who are heading “in” or “out” of a department store in real-time.
